QBS181 -- Notes on potential analyses and plots

1. Line graph showing data over time by country
-incident cases
-active cases
-cumulative cases
-deaths
-consider R shiny app that allows you to select data range and country (and automatically adjust scale to match the data)

2. Matrix allowing us to visualize missing data 
-each country is a row
-each columns is a day 
-color cells based on presence/absence of data on that day and in that country
-same, but each column is a week, and use shading to depict % missing in that week/country 
-same, but each column is a month...
