# Scraping global 2003 population table 
Attribution: used chatGPT for starter code then edited to get correct table

Scrape table
```{r}
# Define the URL of the website
url <- "https://theodora.com/wfb2003/rankings/population_2003_0.html"

# Read the HTML content of the page
webpage <- read_html(url)

# Extract the table from the webpage using CSS selectors
pop <- webpage %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
  .[[2]]  # Second table on the page is the one we want

# Print the scraped table
print(pop)
```

Clean
```{r}
# drop second col
pop <- pop[,-c(2)]

# set first row equal to colnames
colnames(pop) <- c('Rank','Country','Total_Pop')

# drop first row
pop <- pop[-c(1),]

# look
head(pop)

# convert pop to int
pop$Total_Pop <- gsub(",", "", pop$Total_Pop)
pop$Total_Pop <- as.integer(pop$Total_Pop)
head(pop)
```

Save for later use
```{r}
# save as RDS
saveRDS(pop, file = "~/Desktop/Dartmouth/6. Fall 2023 Term/QBS 181 Data Wrangling/5. Final Project/pop.rds")
```
