## Libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(rprojroot)
library(naniar)
```


## Get clean data

```{r}
project_path <- find_rstudio_root_file()
data_path <- paste0(project_path, "/data/")
cleandata <- readRDS(file = paste0(data_path,"cleandata.rds"))
```


## Evaluate missingness

```{r}

# dates with missing data are invisible because they are not in the dataset
# so we create a df that has ALL dates within the range of the raw data
dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date(min(cleandata$Date)),

dates_df <- as.data.frame(dates, col.names = c("Date"))
names(dates_df) <- "Date"
dates_df$Country <- "Dummy"

# append this dates df to our raw data
df <- bind_rows(cleandata, dates_df)

# reshape to wide, focusing on "Cases" column
cases <- df[c("Date","Country","Cases")]
cases_wide <- spread(cases, key = Country, value = Cases) %>%
     mutate(Week = as.numeric(format(Date, "%W")) - 10,
            DOW = as.factor(weekdays(Date)))
