# Libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation
library(deSolve) # for SIR plot
library(rootSolve) # for SIR plot
```

# Load in Data
```{r}
all_sars <- readRDS("~/Desktop/Dartmouth/6. Fall 2023 Term/QBS 181 Data Wrangling/5. Final Project/cleandata.rds")
subset_sars <- readRDS("~/Desktop/Dartmouth/6. Fall 2023 Term/QBS 181 Data Wrangling/5. Final Project/cleandata2.rds")

demos <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Dartmouth/6. Fall 2023 Term/QBS 181 Data Wrangling/5. Final Project/summary_data_clean.csv")
pop <- readRDS("~/Desktop/Dartmouth/6. Fall 2023 Term/QBS 181 Data Wrangling/5. Final Project/pop.rds")
```

Create table of only last entry (with maximum cumulative cases) per country with greater than max cumulative cases
```{r}
max_sars_subset <- subset_sars %>% group_by(Country) %>% summarise_all(last)
print(max_sars_subset)
```

Merge pop data onto new subset of sars (more than 10 cumulative cases)
```{r}
# look for differences in country name
table(max_sars_subset$Country) 
table(pop$Country)

# change Viet Nam to Vietnam
max_sars_subset$Country <- ifelse(max_sars_subset$Country == "Viet Nam", "Vietnam", max_sars_subset$Country)

# merge
max_sars_subset <- merge(max_sars_subset, pop, by="Country", all.x=TRUE)

# check
head(max_sars_subset)
```

# SIR Models
Attribution: the basis of this SIR code was from Applied Epidemiological Methods with Dr. Annie Hoen in Winter Term of 2023.

1. Build a model with three compartments â€“ susceptible (S), infected/infectious (I) and recovered (R). Use the following initial conditions:

0.0001% of the population is infected
Everyone else is susceptible

Transmission rate from here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323341/
Median R0 in Canada = 0.58
Median R0 in Hong Kong = 1.10
Median R0 in Singapore = 1.17

B = 0.25 in Hong Kong (source: Chowell 2004, used to predict R0's above)

Back Calculate gamma (recovery rate) for each country for which I have R0, assuming relationship beta/gamma = R0 and given beta and r0 from literature
```{r}
beta = 0.25

r0_canada <- 0.58
r0_hongkong <- 1.10
r0_singapore <- 1.17

gamma_canada <- beta/r0_canada
gamma_hongkong <- beta/r0_hongkong
gamma_singapore <- beta/r0_singapore
```

Create an SIR function
```{r}
sir <- function(time, state, parameters) {

  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {

    dS <- -beta * S * I
    dI <-  beta * S * I - gamma * I
    dR <-                 gamma * I

    return(list(c(dS, dI, dR)))
  })
}
```

# CANADA
Set parameters
```{r}
# set initial proportion in each compartment: Susceptible 0.999999, Infected 0.000001, Recovered 0
init       <- c(S = 1-1e-6, I = 1e-6, R = 0.0)

# set parameters (beta = infection parameter, gamma = recovery parameter)
parameters_canada <- c(beta = beta, gamma = gamma_canada)

# set time frame (2 years = 730 days)
times <- seq(0, 730, by = 1)
```

Solve using ode (General Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations)
```{r}
# run ode function given parameters, initial proportions, and time frame
out_canada <- ode(y = init, times = times, func = sir, parms = parameters_canada)

## change to data frame
out_canada <- as.data.frame(out_canada)

## Delete time variable
out_canada$time <- NULL

## Show data
tail(out_canada, 10) # 2.380932e-04% of pop infected after 2 years
```

2. Plot the time series of membership in each compartment. At the peak of the epidemic, what proportion of the population is infected? What is the proportion of the population infected during the epidemic (final size)?
```{r}
# find max proportion of pop infected at peak
max(out_canada$I)*100 # 1x10-4 of pop infected at peak

# find max number of pop infected at peak, based on proportion
round((max(out_canada$I))*(max_sars_subset$Total_Pop[max_sars_subset$Country == "Canada"])) # rounded to 32

# at end, what proportion of population had been infected:
max(out_canada$R*100) # 0.00023% of pop

# find number of population at end had been infected7
round((max(out_canada$R))*(max_sars_subset$Total_Pop[max_sars_subset$Country == "Canada"])) # rounded to 77
```

3. Overlay plots (from link)
```{r}
# Plot
matplot(x = times, y = out_canada, type = "l",
        xlab = "Time (Days)", ylab = "Proportion of Population Susceptible and Recovered", main = "SIR Model - Canada",
        lwd = 1, lty = 1, bty = "l", col = 2:4)

# Add legend
legend(40, 0.7, c("Susceptible", "Infected", "Recovered"), pch = 1, col = 2:4, bty = "n")
```

# HONG KONG
Set parameters
```{r}
# set initial proportion in each compartment: Susceptible 0.999999, Infected 0.000001, Recovered 0
init       <- c(S = 1-1e-6, I = 1e-6, R = 0.0)

# set parameters (beta = infection parameter, gamma = recovery parameter)
parameters_hongkong <- c(beta = beta, gamma = gamma_hongkong)

# set time frame (2 years = 730 days)
times <- seq(0, 730, by = 1)
```

Solve using ode (General Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations)
```{r}
# run ode function given parameters, initial proportions, and time frame
out_hongkong <- ode(y = init, times = times, func = sir, parms = parameters_hongkong)

## change to data frame
out_hongkong <- as.data.frame(out_hongkong)

## Delete time variable
out_hongkong$time <- NULL

## Show data
tail(out_hongkong, 10) 
```

2. Plot the time series of membership in each compartment. At the peak of the epidemic, what proportion of the population is infected? What is the proportion of the population infected during the epidemic (final size)?
```{r}

# find max number of pop infected at peak, based on proportion
round((max(out_hongkong$I))*(max_sars_subset$Total_Pop[max_sars_subset$Country == "Hong Kong"])) # rounded to 31,531

# at end, what proportion of population had been infected:
max(out_hongkong$R * 100) # 17.6% of pop

# find number of population at end had been infected
round((max(out_hongkong$R))*(max_sars_subset$Total_Pop[max_sars_subset$Country == "Hong Kong"])) # rounded to 1,300,251
